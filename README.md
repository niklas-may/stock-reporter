# Stock Reporter 

## Status
- The app is not working due to recent changes in the Yahoo API. This issue has been reported on [redit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sheets/comments/1farvxr/broken_yahoo_finance_url/
), [gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2](https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2/issues/795) and will probably pop up soon as an issue on different libraries that wrap the Yahoo finance API.
- The `StockReport` result might not be accurate. I need to find a source for validation.

## Installation
```
$ pnpm install
```

## Usage
Add .env file based on `./.env.example`.

```
$ pnpm cli --help
```
